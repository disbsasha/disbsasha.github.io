    <p class="text">Queen are a British rock band that formed in London in 1970. <br>Their classic line-up was Freddie Mercury (lead vocals and piano), Brian <br>May (lead guitar and vocals), Roger Taylor (drums and vocals), and John <br>Deacon (bass guitar). Their earliest works were influenced by progressive <br>rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more <br>conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, <br>such as arena rock and pop rock, into their music.

<br>Before forming Queen, May and Taylor had played together in the band Smile. <br>Mercury, then known by his birth name, Farrokh Bulsara, was a fan of Smile and <br>encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording <br>techniques. Mercury joined in 1970, suggested the name "Queen", and adopted <br>his familiar stage name. Deacon was recruited before the band recorded their <br>eponymous debut album in 1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second <br>album, Queen II, in 1974, but it was the release of Sheer Heart Attack later <br>that year and A Night at the Opera in 1975 which brought them international <br>success. The latter featured "Bohemian Rhapsody", which stayed at number one <br>in the UK for nine weeks and also helped to popularise the music video.

<br>The band's 1977 album News of the World contained "We Will Rock You" and "We Are <br>the Champions", which have become anthems at sporting events. By the early <br>1980s, Queen were one of the biggest stadium rock bands in the world. "Another <br>One Bites the Dust" (1980) became their best-selling single, while their 1981 <br>compilation album Greatest Hits is the best-selling album in the UK and is <br>certified eight times platinum in the US. Their performance at the 1985 Live <br>Aid concert has been ranked among the greatest in rock history by various <br>music publications. The last concert featuring their classic line up–the final <br>live performance of Mercury–took place at Knebworth, England, in August 1986. <br>In 1991, Mercury died of bronchopneumonia, a complication of AIDS, and Deacon <br>retired in 1997. May and Taylor have performed under the Queen name with Paul <br>Rodgers and Adam Lambert as vocalists on tours since.

<br>Estimates of their record sales range from 170 million to 300 million records, <br>making them one of the world's best-selling music artists. Queen received the <br>Outstanding Contribution to British Music Award from the British Phonographic <br>Industry in 1990. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in <br>2001. Each member of Queen has composed multiple hit singles, and all four <br>band members were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003. In 2005, <br>the band received the Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Song Collection from <br>the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors, and in 2018 they <br>were presented the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.

        <p class="text" style="position: relative; bottom: 900px; left: 1480px">Freddie Mercury (born Farrokh Bulsara; 5 September 1946 – 24 November 1991) was a British singer-songwriter and record producer, best known as the lead vocalist of the rock band Queen.<br> He is regarded as one of the greatest singers in the history of popular music, and was known for his flamboyant stage persona and four-octave vocal range.<br><br>

Mercury was born of Parsi descent in Zanzibar, and grew up there and in India before moving with his family to Middlesex, England, in his late teens. <br>He formed Queen in 1970 with guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor. Mercury wrote numerous hits for Queen, including "Bohemian Rhapsody", "Killer Queen", "Somebody to Love", "Don't Stop Me Now", "Crazy Little Thing Called Love", and "We Are the Champions". <br>He also led a solo career while performing with Queen, and occasionally served as a producer and guest musician for other artists. Mercury died in 1991 at age 45 due to complications from AIDS, having confirmed the day before his death that he had contracted the disease.<br><br>

As a member of Queen, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004.<br> In 1992, a year after his death, Mercury was posthumously awarded the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music, and a tribute concert was held at Wembley Stadium, London. <br>In 2002, he was placed number 58 in the BBC's 2002 poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. Mercury was voted best male singer of all time in a 2005 poll organised by Blender and MTV2.<br><br>

Mercury was also ranked at 18 on the 2008 Rolling Stone list of the 100 greatest singers ever; and ranked the second best lead singer in a 2011 Rolling Stone readers' pick. <br>Mercury was described by AllMusic as "one of rock's greatest all-time entertainers," with "one of the greatest voices in all of music." <br>Upon its release in November 2018, the biographical film about Mercury and Queen, Bohemian Rhapsody, became the highest-grossing musical biographical film of all time.</p>

        <p class="text" style="position: relative; bottom: 1300px; left: 4000px">Roger Meddows Taylor (born 26 July 1949) is an English musician, <br>singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist, best known as the <br>drummer for the rock band Queen. As a drummer, Taylor was recognised <br>early in his career for his unique sound. He was voted by radio <br>listeners as the eighth-greatest drummer in classic rock music history <br>in a poll conducted by Planet Rock in 2005.

<br>As a songwriter, Taylor contributed songs to Queen's albums from the <br>beginning, composing at least one track on every album, and often singing lead <br>vocals on his own compositions. He wrote or co-wrote three UK number 1s <br>("These Are the Days of Our Lives", "Innuendo" and "Under Pressure") and <br>contributed a further five major hits ("Radio Ga Ga", "A Kind of Magic", <br>"Heaven for Everyone", "Breakthru", and "The Invisible Man"). He is also the <br>main writer on the international top-ten hit "One Vision", although the track <br>is credited to the whole band. He has collaborated with such artists as Eric <br>Clapton, Roger Waters, Roger Daltrey, Robert Plant, Phil Collins, Genesis, <br>Jimmy Nail, Elton John, Gary Numan, Shakin' Stevens, Foo Fighters, Al Stewart, <br>Steve Vai, Yoshiki, Cyndi Almouzni, and Bon Jovi. As a producer, he has <br>produced albums by Virginia Wolf, Jimmy Nail and Magnum.

<br>In addition to his drum work, Taylor sometimes played keyboards, guitars and <br>bass on his own songs. During the 1980s, in addition to his work with Queen, <br>he formed a parallel band known as the Cross, in which he was the lead singer <br>and rhythm guitarist. During the early 1980s, Taylor was also a panellist on <br>the popular UK quiz show Pop Quiz, hosted by Mike Read.

<br>In 2014, he appeared in The Life of Rock with Brian Pern as himself. Taylor is <br>also well known for his falsetto vocal range.</p>

            Brian Harold May, CBE (born 19 July 1947) is an English musician, <br>singer, songwriter, astrophysicist and photographer. He is best <br>known as the lead guitarist of the rock band Queen. In 2001, he <br>was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the <br>band's members; and in 2018, he received the Grammy Lifetime <br>Achievement Award which recognises "the most distinctive <br>recordings in music history". He uses a home-built electric guitar <br>called the Red Special. His compositions for the band include "We <br>Will Rock You", "Tie Your Mother Down", "I Want It All", "Fat <br>Bottomed Girls", "Flash", "Hammer to Fall", "Save Me", "Who Wants <br>to Live Forever", and "The Show Must Go On".

<br>May was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer Freddie Mercury and drummer <br>Roger Taylor, having previously performed with Taylor in the band Smile, which <br>he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation <br>in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player John Deacon completing the lineup, <br>Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success <br>of the album A Night at the Opera and its single "Bohemian Rhapsody". From the <br>mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the <br>UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably <br>giving an acclaimed performance at Live Aid in 1985. As a member of Queen, May <br>became regarded as a virtuoso musician and he was identified with a <br>distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work.

<br>Following the death of Mercury in 1991, Queen were put on hiatus for several <br>years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further <br>performances featuring other vocalists. In 2005, a Planet Rock poll saw May <br>voted the 7th greatest guitarist of all time. He was ranked at No. 26 on <br>Rolling Stone magazine's list of the "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time". In <br>2012, he was ranked the 2nd greatest guitarist in a Guitar World magazine <br>readers poll.

<br>May was appointed a CBE by Queen Elizabeth II in 2005 for "services to the <br>music industry and for charity work". May earned a PhD in astrophysics from <br>Imperial College London in 2007, and was Chancellor of Liverpool John Moores <br>University from 2008 to 2013. He was a "science team collaborator" with NASA's <br>New Horizons Pluto mission. He is also a co-founder of the awareness campaign <br>Asteroid Day. Asteroid 52665 Brianmay was named after him. May is also an <br>animal rights activist, campaigning against the hunting of foxes and the <br>culling of badgers in the UK.</p>

          John Richard Deacon (born 19 August 1951) is an English retired <br>musician, best known for being the bass guitarist for the rock band <br>Queen. He composed several songs for the group—including Top 10 hits <br>"You're My Best Friend", "Another One Bites the Dust", "Back Chat", <br>and "I Want to Break Free"—and was involved in the band's financial <br>management.

<br>Deacon grew up in Oadby, Leicestershire, playing bass in a local band, The <br>Opposition, before moving to study electronics at Chelsea College, London. He <br>joined Queen in 1971 on the strength of his musical and electronic skills, <br>particularly the home-made Deacy Amp which guitarist Brian May used to create <br>guitar orchestras throughout Queen's career. From the third album, Sheer Heart <br>Attack, onwards, he wrote at least one song per album, several of which became <br>hits. As well as bass, Deacon played some guitar and keyboards on Queen's <br>studio work, but was the only member never to sing on their albums.

<br>Following lead singer Freddie Mercury's death in 1991, and the following <br>year's Tribute Concert, Deacon only performed a few times with the remaining <br>members of Queen before retiring from the music industry in 1997 after <br>recording "No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)". He has not performed on <br>any of the other projects that the other two surviving members, Brian May and <br>Roger Taylor, have put together.</p>
