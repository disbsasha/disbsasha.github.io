   <p id="paragraph"> Wow this place was already my favorite place to get a NY slice to begin with but something oh so poetic happened a few hours ago and I am still sh√ºk about it. Let me give you some context: I am a college student on a budget living in an expensive city. It it midnight, my hunger growls louder than the realization that the campus dining halls are closed. I dig into my wallet to find only the mere reminisce of what once was currency in the form of loose change that I acquired throughout the semester. Begrudgingly, I collect my loose change and stash it into my pocket and lumber on full well realizing the public humiliation I faced the last time I paid in loose change. Alas I stumble into the humble but great establishment named Joe's Pizza. The jolly thick accented Italian man asks me what I will be having today. "Two cheese," I manage to speak out as I am dreading the next moments to come. He flashes me a smile and plumps the slices into the noble pizza oven. I quickly start giving him a fair warning before he may even speak a few words, "I'm about to pay in quarters please don't judge me I go to college." He shrugs and openly accepts my coins one by one. The man doesn't even look down at the wreckage of shillings slowly collecting at his palms. "How much is that?" he asks. "5 dollars," I replied briskly with chagrin. He shrugs again and clumps my coins into the register. He returns a few moments later with an extra slice and a coke and hands them over to me. At that moment I felt a rush of heavenly aura fall over me. I take a bite. I am euphoric. As I am enjoying my slice the man keeps speaking to me and calling me 'miss.' I turn around to see what he was indicating towards. As if sensing my former state of embarrassment he says "look everybody pays in change" pointing at the customer after me who paid in significantly more dollar bills than I did and just a couple quarters. As I was finishing up my first slice the angelic saint spoke again "Look nobody pays full izzok" he said pointing at another customer. I smiled back but not before I saw the number at the register that read $5:50 the exact amount for the slices the customer got. Either white lie or not. Not only did this beautiful Italian being bless me with free food but also assurance that humanity still exists. So as I exited that beautiful Greenwich staple I vowed to one day be worthy of Joe's pizza so I may pay back this sacred institution what it deserves. I believe in god.</p>
