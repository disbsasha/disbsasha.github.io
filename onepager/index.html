        <p class="text">Thank you for the opportunity to apply for a role at your company. After reviewing your job description, it’s clear that you’re looking for a candidate that is extremely familiar with the responsibilities associated with the role, and can perform them confidently. Given these requirements, I am certain that I have the necessary skills to successfully do the job adeptly and perform above expectations. I’m currently an undergraduate student studying Integrated Digital Media with a minor in Film and Business Entertainment Music Technology (BEMT). During the course of my academic career, I also managed to accrue nearly 5 months of work experience. I had the privilege of working for Telos Corporation in an Intern role in my free time, where I learned valuable professional skills such as efficiency improvement, entrepreneurial leadership, and market development. In both my academic and professional life, I have been consistently praised as hardworking by my professors and peers. I’m currently working for a mobile video editing company making viral creating content, beta testing, and classifying and putting together new editing techniques. Whether working on academic, extracurricular, or professional projects, I have been proven to apply structure, creative thinking, and planning skills, which I hope to leverage into the Intern role at your company. After reviewing my resume, I hope you will agree that I am the type of competent and competitive candidate you are looking for. I look forward to elaborating on how my specific skills and abilities will benefit your organization. Please contact me at 7035018963 or via email ac6268@nyu.edu to arrange for a convenient meeting time. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you soon. </p>
